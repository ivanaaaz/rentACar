The rent-a-car company is engaged in renting vehicles to clients, of different types (small passenger vehicle, medium passenger vehicle, large passenger vehicle, van, minibus, bus). It must refresh its fleet over time, so the user is allowed to rent new vehicles. The received vehicles are entered into the fleet database.

Every car rental company must have a database in which to register clients. Based on that, the company gives regular customers certain benefits and discounts. This is done by the clerk entering each customer in the database. In addition, each new customer is entered into a database to keep records of rented vehicles.

If the customer wants to extend the rent for the vehicle or change the type of vehicle or rental date, the clerk, based on the basic information about the customer, finds the rent in the database and moves the return date, number of rented days, or vehicle type. The customer is then notified of the change in rent. The clerk is obliged to take the personal data of each client and enter them into the database.

The system user has the following functionalities: Insert new vehicle, Search vehicle, Update vehicle, Delete vehicle, Insert new client, Search client, Update client and Delete client.
